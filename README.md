# NASA-JPL
Programs written for work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

\*\* Because of certain APIs and database connections, these programs are not able to run unless you are connected to the JPL WiFi \*\*

## Metrology
Starting March 2020, when we were all sent home during the pandemic, I had started working on writing programs so that I could keep busy. <br>
First, it began with copying a previous program written by an intern (mainly to keep future programs consistent), but as knowledge grew so did the programs. <br>
Now, I am transistioning everything to be on brand with JPL and using Python (my most knowledgable language). <br>
All of these can be done manually, but with the push to try and get complaint to ISO17025, automated procedures will help reduce the calibration time.

### DAQ-Modules
Started during the Pandemic to give me something to do at home  
Written in C# using Visual Studio, based off of another co-workers program to try and keep things consistent  
Now part of the Metrology Suite

### Metrology Suite (in progess)
Wanted to have a suite of programs that were written within the Metrology lab opposed to tons of individual programs  
Written in Python for the backend, HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend using JPL's django template as the base but heavily modified using [Eel](https://github.com/ChrisKnott/Eel)  
Converting, upgrading, and updating older programs of mine as well as others from coworkers in which I have taken over
<br><br>

### Power Supply Calibration (in progess)
Similar to the Metrology Suite, but specifically for the Power Supply Lab
